Just over a week after Davey Martinez and Mike Rizzo were fired from the Washington Nationals, we are into the ceremonial halfway point of the MLB season: the All-Star Break. No longer caught up in "these games matter" nonsense of yesteryear, this week has become a way to inject some more fun into the game, starting with this evening's Home Run Derby. This year will star James Wood, for Nats fans at least, and should introduce him to the wider baseball community with some absolutely massive dongs in Atlanta.

The Nats ended their first half with little more than a whimper, winning just one of their last six games. They were also outscored by their admittedly strong opponents (the Cardinals and Brewers) 36-20 in those games. That's a paltry three-and-a-third runs per game. Anyone who expected massive change and a boost from new leadership was sorely misguided... because nothing really changed. Davey's handpicked bench coach is now the manager. Rizzo's chosen deputy now sits in his former role overseeing baseball operations and responsible for this year's MLB Draft.

Which brings us back to a positive note, at least in my opinion. The Nats had their first 1.1 draft pick since Bryce Harper and Stephen Strasburg before him (elite company, I'd say) and went with young high school shortstop Eli Willits. Just how young? The youngest player ever drafted first overall. The more cynical among us (yes, us. I usually am among this group.) might choose to focus how the Nats picked a player who was projected to go lower to save some dough, because the Lerners are cheap. There may be some amount of truth in that. 

However, there is certainlly reason for optimism. Willits' relatively low cost has given the Nats additional money to spend on the draft and appear to be doing so by re-stocking the farm with some interesting prospects. Ethan Petry was their second pick at #49, projected as a power hitting first baseman, and Landon Harmon came in next at #80. Petry was drafted out of the University of South Carolina (Go Cocks), but it was Harmon who caught my attention. Drafted out of high school and shy of 19 years old, the righty already hits 99 mph with his fastball. That could mean arm issues, but also means serious upside if he can develop other pitches. He's going to have my attention after he signs and starts making appearances in the Nats farm.

There is more draft to come and there are much better folks to read on the subject than yours truly, but I look forward to some meaningless baseball fun this week and hope the Nats' quality of play lends itself to more entertaining viewing and fewer "ugh, what else is on?" moments in the third inning in the second half.
