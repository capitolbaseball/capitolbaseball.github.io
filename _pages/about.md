Joe created Capitol Baseball back in 2010 as an outlet for musings and analysis about the Nats. He moved on to write for and become Editor in Chief of The Nats Blog and co-hosted two podcasts (Nats Talk on the Go and A Triple Shy) before taking a hiatus from baseball writing.

He decided to return under the original Capitol Baseball name and try his hand again at the whole blogging thing and see what sticks. You can expect sports musings that focus on the Nats, baseball, soccer, and maybe other things.
